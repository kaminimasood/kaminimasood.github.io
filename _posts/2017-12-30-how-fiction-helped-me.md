Title: "How Fiction Helped Me Understand History"
---


There are countless ways to scare college students away from history classes. One way, as I found out my sophomore year, is to assign Dostoevsky’s Demons. 
The sheer size of it is enough to send overworked students running for the hills. I know I almost ran.


Over the course of the past five years, I’ve taken numerous history courses ranging from the modern Middle East to Cold War Russia. 
In all but two, I was assigned heavy textbooks and and historical texts to read. In the two Russian history courses, however, 
I was assigned a mixture of historical fiction and non-fiction. This initially struck me as not only new but also a little odd. 
Once I got past the sheer size of Dostoevsky’s Demons and the admittedly unsettling content, 
I realized that fiction has an essential role to play in the study of history, even more importantly so for Russian history. 
This post won’t so much advocate for the usage of fiction in teaching history as it will explain the ways in which I feel my own 
experience of Russian history was affected by the addition of novels and short stories....
